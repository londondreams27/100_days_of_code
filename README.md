# 100_days_of_code

After reading up on various coding languages, I have come to conclude that both Python and C++ are going to be essential in solving 
large number of problems. There are areas where the ease and simplicity of python code will be beneficial while in others the speed of C++ will be required.


In this repository , I want to store codes for various programming problems, and work out how data structures and algorithms work  for both C++ and Python and what are the differences in their implementations.
